ABSTRACT:

The project aims to develop a personalized house price prediction system using machine 
learning techniques. The system utilizes a dataset on Bengaluru house data, where various 
features such as location, total square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and 
availability status are considered for predicting house prices. The project involves data 
cleaning and preparation steps, model building using Random Forest Regressor, model 
evaluation using the R2 score metric, and deployment of the trained model in a web 
application using Streamlit. By creating a personalized prediction system, the project seeks 
to provide accurate and tailored house price predictions for users based on their individual 
preferences and characteristics.
